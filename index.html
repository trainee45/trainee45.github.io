If the Search Phrase is set to SPECIFIC, the found record is returned only if one of its fields is the complete search phrase. CONTAINS means a record is returned if any of its fields just contains the search phrase either as a complete string or as a sub string. For example '3' will return any record containing '3' or '33' or year 2023 etc. So to return a record containing a number 3 only, set Search Phrase to SPECIFIC. The Save Settings button saves your Preferences for each individual database.</p>

<details> <summary>Click to reveal more information about using TABLES in DougieBase </summary>
	<h3>The 3 ways to create a DougieBase table:</h3>
			   There are 3 classes of tables in DougieBase. <br>1. The MAIN table is derived from each DougieBase database and is automatically generated when a new database is created. This is the table shown when you tap the DISPLAY TABLE btn on the Table Options information screen. A MAIN table can be edited, records and dynamic fields added or deleted, searched and sorted.<br>2.  The second class of table is one created from found records in a SEARCH of a MAIN database table. Data can be searched and sorted, but new records can not be added or deleted. If you need to ADD a record you have to revert back to the MAIN database table, from which it originated, and ADD/ or DELETE records to/from the MAIN table, and then repeat the SEARCH to recreate the changed table with the now added record.<br>3. The third class of table references CONTACTS only, .. Contacts that you want to be associated with the database. CONTACTS tables can be created in 3 ways:<br> A. By tapping the CONTACTS button in the menu of a MAIN database table - this method allows access to the CONTACTS app on your device. <br>B. By tapping the CREATE TABLE button on the Table Information window that shows after tapping the TABLE button on the home screen main menu bar. The CREATE TABLE option has the same facility as the CONTACTS button in the Table window menu.<br>C. By tapping the ADD CONTACTS/RECORDS  button on the main database HOME screen menu. - This allows manual entry of Contacts data from a form sheet. There is no access to the ContactsPickerAPI (Contacts) on your device. <br> CONTACTS tables generate 4 FIXED Fields - Name, DATE, Telephone, Email, and 1 DYNAMIC field .. Address … depending on your browser's capability to access the Address field from the ContactPicker API. The 3 types of Contacts tables allow editing of data in the table data cells, adding and deleting (Contacts) records,..(by tapping the + and - icons in the Table menu), and adding and deleting fields, by tapping the EDIT button in the Table menu. Editing of Field Names in the CONTACTS tables, by tapping the EDIT button in the Table menu, allows creation of CUSTOMIZED tables, thus facilitating their use for other purposes than just Contacts.</li>
			   </details>
	 <li><span style = "text-decoration: underline">CUSTOM TABLES:</span> Custom tables can be created in two ways:<br> 1.By using a CONTACTS table as a template, relabeling the FIELD names using the EDIT button, will create customized tables. The EDIT button allows renaming of FIELD headings, and ADDING or DELETING of fields, facilitating the creation of CUSTOM tables for any purpose.<br>2. The ADD CONTACTS/RECORDS button in the Main menu allows labelling of the table field names on the fly, as you create the table and enter record data into the fields from a FORM input screen.</li>
	    <li><span style = "text-decoration: underline"> Field Labels:</span><br> The FIELD LABELS button on the Table screen menu allows editing of the Contacts or new Table fields. CANCEL in this window resets fields to default values for a Contacts table. See documentation.</li>
	    <li><span style = "text-decoration: underline"> CONTACTS btn vrs Field Labels:</span><br>To create contacts tables:
First tap of CONTACTS btn creates a simple CONTACTS table using your device's ContactsAPI.<br>
A first tap of Field Labels Btn will create a CONTACTS table using your device's ContactsAPI but also adding an ADDRESS field.<br>
If you want a simple CONTACTS table with just 4 fields ..name,date,telephone,email..but want to edit the field labels..first tap CONTACTS to set up the 4 fields, and use CANCEL at the table naming stage..then return to the Field Labels btn, and use the EDIT CURRENT FIELDS option to get a simple CONTACTS table that you have been able to change the field names in.<br>
The CANCEL btn: This will reset contactsField names which will allow switching back and forth between 4 fields ending in EMAIL, OR 5 fields ending in ADDRESS. Depending on whether CONTACTS or FIELD LABELS is tapped first you get 4 or 5 fields. If you get 4 but you want 5 with ADDRESS just tap CANCEL in the Action Prompt window and/or in the ENTER NEW TABLE NAME window, and repeat the process following the prompts.<br>
Any table created using the ADD CONTACTS/RECORDS btn from the Main Menu will have a Fifth field initially labelled ADDRESS unless you edit the field names as per options provided.
	    </li>
	    <li>WHEN ENTERING A LINK (To make it active) YOU MUST USE FORMAT: 'http://text of link label.com/'. Note the forward slash at the end of the link!</li>
	    <li>In FIXED field headers, (columns 1 to 4 of a table) use keywords TELEPHONE (3rd column header) EMAIL (4th column header) or in any DYNAMIC field header (columns 5 and up) which when double-tapped will activate telephone numbers to make phone calls or email addresses to create emails when the data cell in that column is also double-tapped.</li>
	    <li>Keywords TOTAL, AVERAGE, and COST or $ included in the field/column header of any DYNAMIC field header will perform the appropriate operation on that column of data when the field header is double-tapped. COST or $ can only be used with TOTAL or AVERAGE and simply adds a $ sign to the result.</li>
	    <li>Numerical data in data cells of DYNAMIC fields can be ADDED across the row leaving the sum total result in the last column of the row. If the field header of that row includes the keyword TOTAL, the last column can also be totaled vertically summing all the results of the record rows that have been summed across the row. You must adhere to this RULE for initiating summing values for numerical entries in the DYNAMIC fields of each row - 
	    <br/>RULE: 'sumAcross' keyword inserted in the data cell which is the last column of the FIRST record of the table and then subsequent records, will initiate summing of all numerical entries (in DYNAMIC fields only), across that record row of the table. The TOTAL keyword included in the field heading of the last column in the table will facilitate adding all numerical entries vertically in the table column, IF THE LAST DATA CELL (last column) OF THE FIRST RECORD  was initialized with the 'sumAcross' keyword. The TOTAL keyword included in field headings of all other columns (DYNAMIC fields only) works as indicated."
	    </li>
	    <li>If you have a column of data you do not want to be included in the summing across a record's fields, mark that number with an extra character, and it will be excluded from the sum. i.e 100 will be added in a sum across the records fields, but 100% or 100! Will NOT be included in the sum. However these numbers are included when summing or averaging numbers vertically in the column.</li>

		   <ul>
			   <li>Last revision: August 21 2023</li>
			   <li>This is Version 50, service worker 53</li> 
			   <li>Improved workflow of creating a new database, including online prompts and flashing 'Do this next indicators'</li>
			   
			   <li>Now compatible with 'Dark Mode'.</li>
			   <li>More responsive design for smart phones</li>
			   <li>Added CONTACTS button to Table menu to allow access to information from the device's contacts. The contactsPickerAPI must be enabled in your browser. In Safari see browser settings ADVANCED. A table of these contacts can be created.</li>
			   <li>Create new tables of Contacts from your device or manually enter new contacts. A '+' button on the new table screen allows manual entry of new contacts or new record data to a pre-existing table. A '-' button allows deleting a record from a new table.</li>
			   <li>A new table can be created listing just the found records (hits) from a successful search.</li>
			   <li>Custom tables, with unique field names can be created for any purpose, using the ADD CONTACTS/RECORDS option from the main menu. See more notes on use of tables in the About DougieBase section and in the documentation.</li>
			   <li>Access to all SHARE Options from the iOS SHARE SHEET: From the Backup Database window, the backup data can be inserted into an email, and sent anywhere using the device's share sheet. This can be useful to send a database to anyone using the Dougiebase app.</li>
			     <li>EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE NOW ACTIVE. <br> If the 4th FIXED Field is labelled 'EMAIL', (for example in a CONTACTS table) then the email addresses in this column will become 'active' if you DOUBLE-TAP on the EMAIL field heading. The EMAIL field heading will be flashing indicating email addresses are active. Now double-tapping on the email address will send an email to this address using the device's native emailer. By tapping the HOME BUTTON, you cancel email address activation and DougieBase returns to its normal edit mode.</li>
			     <li>As of Sept 11 2022, can now edit the single record view obtained as a result of a record search.</li>
			     <li>A database backup can now be restored by accessing the native FILES system. This allows storage of backups in any file accessible to iOS FILES app, or the file system of the OS being used. See information in the Restore DataBase section.</li>
			     <li>If using iOS, or iPadOS, you can now SAVE DougieBase databases to the native FILES app by using the DougieBase extension 'DougieBase SAVE to FILES' shortcut via the SHARE sheet. From the backup screen in DougieBase tap the 'SHARE ..database name'..button, and on the SHARE OPTIONS that are then listed, tap on the DougieBase SAVE to FILES shortcut, and follow the prompts. You need to have a DougieBaseBKUPS folder created beforehand, in your iCloud Drive.  DougieBase can RESTORE databases from this folder as well. Download the DougieBase SAVE to FILES shortcut from the HELP/DOCUMENTATION window.</li>
			     <li>Use uppercase keywords TOTAL AVERAGE COST in field title (Dynamic fields only) for added functionality! (COST needs to be used with TOTAL or AVERAGE). Use TELEPHONE (in third FIXED field or any DYNAMIC field) to activate telephone number for calling. Use EMAIL (in 4th FIXED field or any DYNAMIC field) for activating email addresses. Double Tap FIELD HEADER containing TELEPHONE EMAIL TOTAL COST or AVERAGE to obtain result! The COST keyword simply pre-appends a $ sign to the result. A field title of form AGE (TOTAL) or AGE (AVERAGE) will post-append yrs to the result.</li>
			     <li>TEMPLATE for a Budget Spread Sheet: Tapping this button will load in a TEMPLATE for a budget sheet and will direct you to CHANGE THE MONTH and YEAR as appropriate, and then to RENAME the budget sheet accordingly creating a new Budget Spread Sheet for the desired month.</li>
			     <li>SUMMARY OF KEYWORDS: <br/>
			       In FIXED field headers, (columns 1 to 4 of a table) use keywords TELEPHONE (3rd column header) EMAIL (4th column header) or in any DYNAMIC field header (columns 5 and up) which when double-tapped will activate telephone numbers to make phone calls or email addresses to create emails when the data cell in that column, containing a phone number or email address is also double-tapped.<br/>
	    Keywords TOTAL, AVERAGE, and COST included in the field/column header of any DYNAMIC field header will perform the appropriate operation on that column of data when the field header is double-tapped. The data entered in the data cells of the table must be a straight number with no units, in order to be included in sums across the row. If units or extra characters are added, these values are included in vertical summations of the column, but not included in 'horizontal' summations across a record row. See SUM ACROSS keyword below. COST can only be used with TOTAL or AVERAGE and simply adds a $ sign to the result. AGE adds the word yrs to the result.
			   
			     </li>
			     
			 <li>The sumAcross keyword: Numerical data in data cells of DYNAMIC fields can be ADDED across the row leaving the sum total result in the last column of the row. If the field header of that row includes the keyword TOTAL, the last column can also be totaled vertically summing all the results of the record rows that have been summed across the row. You must adhere to this RULE for initiating summing values for numerical entries in the DYNAMIC fields across each row. This sum is automatically updated in the first data section of NOTES if that section has the predefined entry of 'Cost to date = $' or 'Total to date = ' in that data cell. 
	    <br/>RULE: 'sumAcross' keyword inserted in the data cell which is the last column of the FIRST record of the table and then subsequent records, will initiate summing of all numerical entries in DYNAMIC fields only, across that record row of the table. Any character(s) added to the number entry will exclude that number from the 'sum across' addition. The TOTAL keyword in the field heading of the last column in the table will facilitate adding all numerical entries vertically in the table column, IF THE LAST DATA CELL (last column) OF THE FIRST RECORD  was initialized with the 'sumAcross' keyword. The TOTAL keyword in field headings of all other columns (DYNAMIC fields only) works as indicated."
	    </li>
	     <li>If you have a column of data you do not want to be included in the summing across a record's fields (horizontally), mark that number with an extra character, and it will be excluded from the sum of values in data cells across that row. i.e 100 will be added in a sum across the record's fields, but 100% or 100! or $100 will NOT be included in the sum. However these numbers ARE INCLUDED when summing or averaging numbers vertically in the column.</li>
	     <li>Database FILENAMES can now be RENAMED. Due to limitations of browser functions, the file has to be RENAMED in DougieBase then backed up to external storage, and when RESTORED to DougieBase will be listed with its new filename.</li>
	     <li>The SCROLL BUTTON in the NOTES section now scrolls to the record last searched for or last edited in the main table.</li>
	     <li>If a database file is deleted, but the action is blocked by the browser, this is indicated in the file names list. Such a file is automatically deleted by DougieBase when the browser releases its lock. DougieBase remembers such files if the user shuts down the app and returns later. (In this scenario the user has to repeat the delete action in the current session, for such a file to be deleted. The RENAME DATABASE routine also automatically deletes the old/original file if it is renamed.</li>
	     <li>In a budget sheet, the table's field heading with the current date is highlighted.</li>
	     <li>By appending these tags to a filename: ✅, -tag , * , ! ,♥️,🔴,❗️the filename will flash when listed. (If flashing is enabled by tapping the 'Flash tagged filenames' button in the DataBase List window). Add or remove tags using RENAME Database in the MANAGE FILES window. </li>
	     <!-- ✅, "-tag" , "*" , "!" ,♥️,🔴,❗️ -->
	     <li>Back Up reminders and Save warnings added if enabled in Preferences.</li>
	      <li>Improved responsive design for small devices.</li>
	       <li>Added FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section .</li>
	        <li>Added an in-app CALCULATOR .</li>
	        <li>Using IMAGE as a field name label allows storage of a URL link to an image. Images can only be stored in table columns that have (or contain) the heading IMAGE. See the FAQ 'How do I best add an image to a database in a specified IMAGE field' in the FAQ section for more information.</li>

<!-- <p style = "color:black">FIRST USE OF DOUGIEBASE?</p> -->
(IF first use of DougieBase make sure you have created a folder named DougieBaseBKUPS in your iCloud Drive….'iCloudDrive/DougieBaseBKUPS'….and that you have downloaded the DougieBase'SaveToFiles' shortcut, by tapping 'Download DougieBase SAVE to FILES.shortcut' in the HELP section of the DougieBase app).
<br><br>
To SEND a database file via iMsg:
<br>
Open your FILES App in iCloudDrive/DougieBaseBKUPS, and tap on the database file you wish to send via iMsg. In this case we will use the Victoria Restaurants database. Tap on the option to open the native Action Sharesheet, and choose the iMsg icon/action. Enter the iMsg address of person you are sending the file too.
<br><br>
To RECEIVE a database file via iMsg:<br>
To receive the database file, open iMsg at the received message, and tap on the file attachment icon in the message, tap on the ACTION SHARESHEET icon, and choose to <mark>open the file in your FILES app in the iCloudDrive/DougieBaseBKUPS folder</mark>. Now you can open your DougieBase app and choose RESTORE from Backup in the Current Database File Names window, and open your iCloudDrive/DougieBaseBKUPS folder and select the Victoria Restaurants database file.</p>

                <p>You can load in a DougieBase database file from any folder in your storage file system by tapping the '<scan style = "color:red"> RESTORE from Backup</scan>' button on the 'Current File Names' window which you reach from the 'NEW/CHANGE DB' button in the main menu bar of DougieBase. To <scan style ="color:red"> BACKUP/EXPORT </scan> a database file using the 'DOUGIEBASE Save to FILES' iOS shortcut, you must have previously created a folder labelled DougieBaseBKUPS in your iCloudDrive. The path has to be 'iCloudDrive/DougieBaseBKUPS'. Follow the prompts during the process. On a non-Apple device you can just backup the database file to the clipboard, and then outside of DougieBase use your OS's file storage system to move or save the file from clipboard to whichever folder in which you wish to store DougiBase database files. These are simple .txt files. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
                <p>If you have viewed or otherwise acted on a database you subsequently DELETE, you will find the browser has put a temporary LOCK on the file. If DougieBase initiated the DELETE such as occurs during a RENAME process or during a creation of a new budget sheet, DougieBase waits for the 'time out' and then will DELETE the file. You will receive a notification when this occurs. If the user DELETED the file, wait for the browser to release its LOCK and try again. If you close the app and restart the app this sometimes releases the LOCK. In any case DougieBase remembers that a lock was placed on the file and on restart highlights the filename in green with a red border immediately on re-listing the file names, if it's a budget Template file, and in grey with red border (after attempting to re-open), if it's a previously deleted database,  reminding the user to DELETE the file again. Go direct to MANAGE, tap on the appropriate file to be deleted and tap DELETE. Don't open the file before doing this as the browser will then put another LOCK on it.</p>

If you have viewed the older version, and then try to delete the older version so as to update it to the more recent version, the browser will have put a temporary LOCK on the file, and it will then be listed as 'BLOCKED'.

                <p>In a budget sheet template for any month, the DATE field is the same for all items, around Nov 2022? Why?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
                <p>In a regular DougieBase database, the DATE field reflects the date any particular record in the database was created or added to the database. Monthly Budget Sheets are generated by the normal DougieBase database engine, and thus the DATE field in a budget sheet template is less functional. The date reflects when the budget sheet template itself was created. If you add another record or item to your budget sheet, the DATE field for that item will reflect the date on which you added the item.</p>

            <div class="accordion__question">
                <p>If I edit a database, and then back it up using the same 'filename', I get an error message saying 'filename.txt' already exists in this location. Can not rename 'filename'? Do I have to use a modified filename or a different location to save the backup?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
                <p>The DougieBase SAVE to FILES + (delete) shortcut has been reprogrammed to take this into account. The shortcut now automatically appends the timestamp to the filename, thus altering the name to a unique filename allowing the shortcut to make the SAVE. This means you will have more than one iteration of 'filename.txt' but each with a different timestamp. You can now choose to clean up your DougieBase storage folder, and delete any 'filename.txt + timestamp' that you do not want to keep..</p>

                <p>How do I best add an image to a database in a specified IMAGE field?</p>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion__answer">
                <p>Not all public photo storage web sites for security reasons will allow a third party app to download and view photos. Designate a field in your database to hold links to images that you have stored in the cloud. Three of the best servers for this are Dropbox and One Notes One Drive, and Box. Google Drive, Amazon Photos and Apple iCloud Drive also will work for this.  Create a field in your database and label it 'IMAGE'. Go to your photo cloud storage and obtain the link to your photo. (The link will be 'copied' to your clipboard.) In One Drive you need to use the share sheet option and email yourself the link, and 'copy' it from your email. Now 'paste' just the link (no extra words or comments) into the appropriate td data cell via the standard DougieBase EDIT process. Save the table. Now you can view the photo simply by tapping on the link. NOTE: You can put just about any link to any web page into the 'IMAGE' field data cell and it will work. The reverse is not true. Putting an IMAGE link into any field data cell not labelled 'IMAGE' will cause an error on loading the image. Also note that the field heading label needs only contain 'IMAGE'. So both 'IMAGE' and 'Locomotive IMAGE' field  labels will work.</p>
