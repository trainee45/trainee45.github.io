			   <li><span style = "text-decoration: underline">A note about Tables:</span><br> There are 3 classes of tables in DougieBase. <br>1. The MAIN table is derived from each DougieBase database and is automatically generated when a new database is created. This is the table shown when you tap the DISPLAY TABLE btn on the Table Options information screen. A MAIN table can be edited, records and dynamic fields added or deleted, searched and sorted.<br>2.  The second class of table is one created from found records in a SEARCH of a MAIN database table. Data can be searched and sorted, but new records can not be added or deleted. If you need to ADD a record you have to revert back to the MAIN database table, from which it originated, and ADD/ or DELETE records to/from the MAIN table, and then repeat the SEARCH to recreate the changed table with the now added record.<br>3. The third class of table references CONTACTS only, .. Contacts that you want to be associated with the database. CONTACTS tables can be created in 3 ways:<br> A. By tapping the CONTACTS button in the menu of a MAIN database table - this method allows access to the CONTACTS app on your device. <br>B. By tapping the CREATE TABLE button on the Table Information window that shows after tapping the TABLE button on the home screen main menu bar. The CREATE TABLE option has the same facility as the CONTACTS button in the Table window menu.<br>C. By tapping the ADD CONTACTS/RECORDS  button on the main database HOME screen menu. - This allows manual entry of Contacts data from a form sheet. There is no access to the ContactsPickerAPI (Contacts) on your device. <br> CONTACTS tables generate 4 FIXED Fields - Name, DATE, Telephone, Email, and 1 DYNAMIC field .. Address ‚Ä¶ depending on your browser's capability to access the Address field from the ContactPicker API. The 3 types of Contacts tables allow editing of data in the table data cells, adding and deleting (Contacts) records,..(by tapping the + and - icons in the Table menu), and adding and deleting fields, by tapping the EDIT button in the Table menu. Editing of Field Names in the CONTACTS tables, by tapping the EDIT button in the Table menu, allows creation of CUSTOMIZED tables, thus facilitating their use for other purposes than just Contacts.</li>
	 <li><span style = "text-decoration: underline">CUSTOM TABLES:</span> Custom tables can be created in two ways:<br> 1.By using a CONTACTS table as a template, relabeling the FIELD names using the EDIT button, will create customized tables. The EDIT button allows renaming of FIELD headings, and ADDING or DELETING of fields, facilitating the creation of CUSTOM tables for any purpose.<br>2. The ADD CONTACTS/RECORDS button in the Main menu allows labelling of the table field names on the fly, as you create the table and enter record data into the fields from a FORM input screen.</li>
	    <li><span style = "text-decoration: underline"> Field Labels:</span><br> The FIELD LABELS button on the Table screen menu allows editing of the Contacts or new Table fields. CANCEL in this window resets fields to default values for a Contacts table. See documentation.</li>
	    <li><span style = "text-decoration: underline"> CONTACTS btn vrs Field Labels:</span><br>To create contacts tables:
First tap of CONTACTS btn creates a simple CONTACTS table using your device's ContactsAPI.<br>
A first tap of Field Labels Btn will create a CONTACTS table using your device's ContactsAPI but also adding an ADDRESS field.<br>
If you want a simple CONTACTS table with just 4 fields ..name,date,telephone,email..but want to edit the field labels..first tap CONTACTS to set up the 4 fields, and use CANCEL at the table naming stage..then return to the Field Labels btn, and use the EDIT CURRENT FIELDS option to get a simple CONTACTS table that you have been able to change the field names in.<br>
The CANCEL btn: This will reset contactsField names which will allow switching back and forth between 4 fields ending in EMAIL, OR 5 fields ending in ADDRESS. Depending on whether CONTACTS or FIELD LABELS is tapped first you get 4 or 5 fields. If you get 4 but you want 5 with ADDRESS just tap CANCEL in the Action Prompt window and/or in the ENTER NEW TABLE NAME window, and repeat the process following the prompts.<br>
Any table created using the ADD CONTACTS/RECORDS btn from the Main Menu will have a Fifth field initially labelled ADDRESS unless you edit the field names as per options provided.
	    </li>
	    <li>WHEN ENTERING A LINK (To make it active) YOU MUST USE FORMAT: 'http://text of link label.com/'. Note the forward slash at the end of the link!</li>
	    <li>In FIXED field headers, (columns 1 to 4 of a table) use keywords TELEPHONE (3rd column header) EMAIL (4th column header) or in any DYNAMIC field header (columns 5 and up) which when double-tapped will activate telephone numbers to make phone calls or email addresses to create emails when the data cell in that column is also double-tapped.</li>
	    <li>Keywords TOTAL, AVERAGE, and COST or $ included in the field/column header of any DYNAMIC field header will perform the appropriate operation on that column of data when the field header is double-tapped. COST or $ can only be used with TOTAL or AVERAGE and simply adds a $ sign to the result.</li>
	    <li>Numerical data in data cells of DYNAMIC fields can be ADDED across the row leaving the sum total result in the last column of the row. If the field header of that row includes the keyword TOTAL, the last column can also be totaled vertically summing all the results of the record rows that have been summed across the row. You must adhere to this RULE for initiating summing values for numerical entries in the DYNAMIC fields of each row - 
	    <br/>RULE: 'sumAcross' keyword inserted in the data cell which is the last column of the FIRST record of the table and then subsequent records, will initiate summing of all numerical entries (in DYNAMIC fields only), across that record row of the table. The TOTAL keyword in the field heading of the last column in the table will facilitate adding all numerical entries vertically in the table column, IF THE LAST DATA CELL (last column) OF THE FIRST RECORD  was initialized with the 'sumAcross' keyword. The TOTAL keyword in field headings of all other columns (DYNAMIC fields only) works as indicated."
	    </li>
	    <li>If you have a column of data you do not want to be included in the summing across a record's fields, mark that number with an extra character, and it will be excluded from the sum. i.e 100 will be added in a sum across the records fields, but 100% or 100! Will NOT be included in the sum. However these numbers are included when summing or averaging numbers vertically in the column.</li>

			   <li>Create new tables of Contacts from your device or manually enter new contacts. A '+' button on the new table screen allows manual entry of new contacts or new record data to a pre-existing table. A '-' button allows deleting a record from a new table.</li>
			   <li>A new table can be created listing just the found records (hits) from a successful search.</li>
			   <li>Custom tables, with unique field names can be created for any purpose, using the ADD CONTACTS/RECORDS option from the main menu. See more notes on use of tables in the About DougieBase section and in the documentation.</li>
			   <li>Access to all SHARE Options from the iOS SHARE SHEET: From the Backup Database window, the backup data can be inserted into an email, and sent anywhere using the device's share sheet. This can be useful to send a database to anyone using the Dougiebase app.</li>
			     <li>EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE NOW ACTIVE. <br> If the 4th FIXED Field is labelled 'EMAIL', (for example in a CONTACTS table) then the email addresses in this column will become 'active' if you DOUBLE-TAP on the EMAIL field heading. The EMAIL field heading will be flashing indicating email addresses are active. Now double-tapping on the email address will send an email to this address using the device's native emailer. By tapping the HOME BUTTON, you cancel email address activation and DougieBase returns to its normal edit mode.</li>
			     <li>As of Sept 11 2022, can now edit the single record view obtained as a result of a record search.</li>
			     <li>A database backup can now be restored by accessing the native FILES system. This allows storage of backups in any file accessible to iOS FILES app, or the file system of the OS being used. See information in the Restore DataBase section.</li>
			     <li>If using iOS, you can now SAVE DougieBase databases to the native FILES app by using the DougieBase extension DougieBase SAVE to FILES shortcut via the SHARE sheet. From the backup screen in DougieBase tap the 'SHARE ..database name'..button, and on the SHARE OPTIONS that are then listed, tap on the DougieBase SAVE to FILES shortcut, and follow the prompts. You need to have a DougieBaseBKUPS folder created in your iCloud Drive.  DougieBase can RESTORE databases from this folder as well.</li>
			     <li>Use uppercase keywords TOTAL AVERAGE COST in field title (Dynamic fields only) for added functionality! (COST needs to be used with TOTAL or AVERAGE). Use TELEPHONE (in third FIXED field or any DYNAMIC field) to activate telephone number for calling. Use EMAIL (in 4th FIXED field or any DYNAMIC field) for activating email addresses. Double Tap FIELD HEADER containing TELEPHONE EMAIL TOTAL COST or AVERAGE to obtain result! The COST keyword simply pre-appends a $ sign to the result. A field title of form AGE (TOTAL) or AGE (AVERAGE) will post-append yrs to the result.</li>
			     <li>SUMMARY OF KEYWORDS: <br/>
			       In FIXED field headers, (columns 1 to 4 of a table) use keywords TELEPHONE (3rd column header) EMAIL (4th column header) or in any DYNAMIC field header (columns 5 and up) which when double-tapped will activate telephone numbers to make phone calls or email addresses to create emails when the data cell in that column is also double-tapped.<br/>
	    Keywords TOTAL, AVERAGE, and COST included in the field/column header of any DYNAMIC field header will perform the appropriate operation on that column of data when the field header is double-tapped. The data entered in the data cells of the table must be a straight number with no units. COST can only be used with TOTAL or AVERAGE and simply adds a $ sign to the result. AGE adds the word yrs to the result.
			   
			     </li>
			     
			 <li>The sumAcross keyword: Numerical data in data cells of DYNAMIC fields can be ADDED across the row leaving the sum total result in the last column of the row. If the field header of that row includes the keyword TOTAL, the last column can also be totaled vertically summing all the results of the record rows that have been summed across the row. You must adhere to this RULE for initiating summing values for numerical entries in the DYNAMIC fields of each row - 
	    <br/>RULE: 'sumAcross' keyword inserted in the data cell which is the last column of the FIRST record of the table and then subsequent records, will initiate summing of all numerical entries in DYNAMIC fields only, across that record row of the table. Any character(s) added to the number entry will exclude that number from the 'sum across' addition. The TOTAL keyword in the field heading of the last column in the table will facilitate adding all numerical entries vertically in the table column, IF THE LAST DATA CELL (last column) OF THE FIRST RECORD  was initialized with the 'sumAcross' keyword. The TOTAL keyword in field headings of all other columns (DYNAMIC fields only) works as indicated."
	    </li>
	     <li>If you have a column of data you do not want to be included in the summing across a record's fields, mark that number with an extra character, and it will be excluded from the sum. i.e 100 will be added in a sum across the records fields, but 100% or 100! Will NOT be included in the sum. However these numbers are included when summing or averaging numbers vertically in the column.</li>
